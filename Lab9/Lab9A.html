<h2>Lab #9A: Sketching Scene Graphs</h2>

<p>Below you will find plain-English descriptions of scenes including one or more objects. For each, draw a scene graph that you think would be appropriate for modeling the scene and its objects.</p>

<h3>Scene 1</h3>

<p>A child's swing is suspended from a metal A-frame, and the swing can swing forward and backward. A small robot sits in the swing, but it does not move other than riding along on the swing.</p>

<p>What moves in the scene and what does not? How are the objects related to one another?</p>

<h3>Scene 2</h3>

<p>There is a riderless bicycle traveling in a winding path around a dirt lot. The bicycle wheels spin as the bicycle moves forward, and as the bicycle turns its handlebars and front wheels also turn left or right together.</p>

<p>What separate parts do you need for your bicycle model? What transformations apply to each?</p>

<h3>Scene 3</h3>

<p>A driverless car navigates the streets of a small town with a few buildings. The car has two doors that can open (on hinges), all four wheels spin as the car moves, the front wheels turn left or right when the car makes a corner.</p>

<p>What are the separate parts of your car model? What transformations are needed to handle all of the desired movements?</p>
